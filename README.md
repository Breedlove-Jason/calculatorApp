## Summary

In 2021, I began my journey to becoming a self-taught software developer.
This javascript calculator app became the third official project in my portfolio.
It challenged me to work with mathematical operations, loops,
functions
and allowed me to get hands on with the DOM by accessing and isolating elements and performing operations on them.
Until now, my experience has been in back-end development,
mainly in Python and Java,
so javascript has given me an opportunity
to learn more and become proficient in the front-end aspect of programming.
I decided to change my path to becoming a full-stack developer, and this was the third time I have ever used javascript.
